Orestes Bloom filters
===================

This is a set of Bloom filters we implemented as we found all existing open-source implementations to be lacking in various aspects. We will publish a statistical and performance analysis soon. Documentation on how to use these Bloom filters from a single applications as well as in a distributed, concurrent, Redis-based implementation will also follow.
